<h1>Caffeine (A FUD Key logger and Data Exflirtator)</h1>

Caffeine is a computer malware, more specifically a fully undetectable key logger. The malware copies itself in a hidden windows directory and logs all the key presses. It stores them in a text file adding the timestamp of each key press, in addition to a confidential file of your choice and mails it to a specific email address each time the computer starts .

The malware can get but itâ€™s not limited to: getting the credentials of a victim, bank passwords, emails, files, usage patterns and confidential information. Caffeine offers the possibility of further extension up to a certain point that does not raise any red flags in the system thus triggering the Antivirus.
